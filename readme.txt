Easy Sticky Post is a plugin that stick your last 'n' blog posts to the homepage.

== Description ==

Developed by [www.lije-creative.com](http://www.lije-creative.com), this module will automatically stick a defined number of posts (default blog post) to the homepage. It will update itself if you add, remove, edit a post or change your permalink structure or update your categories.
It is particularly useful since the new Twenty Fourteen Wordpress theme promote the 'sticked blog posts'.
